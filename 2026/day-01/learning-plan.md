My name is Aman Sharma, and I am currently working at Oracle as a Change Implementation Analyst. I have an IT background, and I want to grow further in my technical career with better long-term stability.

To achieve this, I have started learning Cloud and DevOps. I strongly believe that consistent hard work can outperform raw talent, and I am ready to put in the effort required. My goal is to build a strong career either as a Cloud Engineer or a DevOps Engineer.

To me, DevOps is a culture that improves the speed and reliability of application delivery by focusing on automation, quality, testing, and continuous monitoring.

Over the next 90 days, I am fully committed to upskilling. I plan to dedicate 3-4 hours every day to learning and practice. By the end of this period, my goal is to have:

Strong hands-on experience with AWS

The ability to deploy a production-grade application on Kubernetes

Good troubleshooting and problem-solving skills

I am highly motivated, disciplined, and ready to put in late-night efforts to achieve this transition.
